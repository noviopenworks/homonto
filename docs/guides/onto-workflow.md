# The onto workflow

**onto** is a spec-driven development workflow that homonto ships as a
bundled framework. It has two halves that work together:

- the **`onto` binary** (built from `cmd/onto/`, installed beside
  `homonto`) — the deterministic operator that creates change workspaces,
  gates phase transitions, merges spec deltas, and archives completed
  changes; and
- the **`onto-*` skills** (materialized from the builtin catalog by
  `homonto apply`) — the agent-facing process prose that drives the work
  inside each phase.

The binary owns the *state and the gates*; the skills own the *work*. A
change moves through five phases in a fixed order:

```
open → design → build → verify → close
```

`close` is terminal; `onto close` then archives the change. Each change
tracks its phase and gate evidence in an `onto-state.yaml` inside its
workspace directory, always written through the binary and never by hand.

This guide covers the concepts. The precise command surface and every gate:
[onto reference](onto-reference.md). Making the gates non-skippable at the
tool boundary: [enforcement](enforcement.md).

## Install and enable

`onto` is version-stamped and installs alongside `homonto`:

```bash
go install github.com/noviopenworks/homonto/cmd/onto@latest
onto version            # prints: onto <version>
```

The mutating commands (`init`, `new`, `set`, `advance`, `close`, `abandon`,
`merge-deltas`) require the onto framework to be **declared and applied
through homonto first**. This is how the skills land in your tools:

```toml
[frameworks.onto]
source = "builtin:onto"
scope = "project"
# plus a [subagents.<name>.<tool>] model block per onto agent — see the
# configuration reference
```

Then `homonto apply`. The read-only commands (`status`, `state`, `gate`,
`scale`, `graph`, `dirt`, `handoff`, `doctor`, `version`) run without any of
this: they never read `homonto.toml` and never write.

`homonto apply` also installs the framework's **slash commands** into each
tool: `/onto` (the dispatcher — it derives the active change's real phase
and routes automatically), plus `/onto-open`, `/onto-design`, `/onto-build`,
`/onto-verify`, `/onto-close`, `/onto-fix`, `/onto-tweak`, and
`/onto-no-slop`. Each command loads its matching `onto-*` skill; every state
change still goes through the binary.

## The layout

`onto init` scaffolds four directories under the workspace root,
idempotently — existing content is never overwritten:

```
docs/
├── changes/                # change workspaces + archive
│   ├── <name>/             # active change (onto-state.yaml, proposal, …)
│   └── archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/
├── specs/                  # living capability specs
├── adr/                    # accepted / superseded decisions
└── guides/                 # user-facing docs
```

## Phase walkthrough

The `onto-*` skills carry the process discipline inside each phase; the
binary gates the transitions between them.

- **open** — clarify the requirement, decide whether the work should split
  into several changes, and create the workspace (`onto new`).
- **design** — ground-truth exploration, 2–3 candidate approaches, user
  confirmation, then `design.md`, ADR drafts (unnumbered,
  `Status: Proposed`), delta specs with testable scenarios, and the task
  list derived from the confirmed design. No implementation code in this
  phase.
- **build** — `plan.md` of bite-sized verified tasks, one commit per task,
  root-cause-first debugging on any failure. The task list is **live
  state**: discovered work is appended as a new task before its code is
  written, and checkoffs ride each task's own commit, so a fresh session
  resumes from the first unchecked task. Entering build requires an
  isolation choice (`branch` or `worktree`); build work is never committed
  unisolated.
- **verify** — scale-appropriate check of every delta-spec scenario with
  fresh command output as evidence, recorded in `verification.md`.
  `onto scale` derives the appropriate verification level from the measured
  diff.
- **close** — `onto merge-deltas` merges the change's delta specs into
  `docs/specs/` deterministically, then `onto close` archives the workspace
  once all evidence gates pass. Number and accept ADRs into `docs/adr/`, and
  update the affected guides.

Two **presets** run a reduced path for small work: `onto new --workflow fix`
(an existing-behavior bug) and `--workflow tweak` (copy/config/docs-scale
change) go `open-lite → build → verify → close`, skipping design, and
upgrade to the full path when scope grows. `onto abandon` is the
unsuccessful terminal state for work that stops rather than completes.

## Specialist subagents

`homonto apply` installs the framework's subagents, which the onto skills
delegate to. Do not also declare them in a top-level `[subagents.*]` table;
the names collide.

- **`onto-explorer`** — read-only; reads across many files to answer "how
  does X work / where does behavior live", returning conclusions rather than
  dumps. Used for grounding in open and design. Runs on the `trivial` model
  route.
- **`onto-reviewer`** — read-only; reviews a diff for correctness, security,
  contract, and clarity, ranked by severity. Used per task in build and
  across the diff in verify. Runs on the `review` route.
- **`onto-implementer`** — edit-capable executor on the `coding` route. It
  executes one bite-sized task from a precise spec and returns a diff. It
  does not plan or judge scope, and it reports discovered work rather than
  doing it.
- **`onto-skeptic`** — read-only adversarial verifier on the
  `review` route, used in the verify phase. It is dispatched **twice
  in parallel**, one lens each (`conformance`: refute each scenario's
  evidence; `robustness`: attack the gaps the scenarios never cover), and is
  prompted to **refute, never approve** (ADR 0007). It keeps bash so it can
  re-run the evidence itself, and it is read-only so it can never fix what
  it finds. That independence is the point.

Everything else — planning, judging scope, deciding, committing — stays with
the orchestrator, because those steps are gated on user confirmation and a
subagent cannot prompt.

All declare their capabilities once in a tool-neutral `homonto:` frontmatter
block, rendered into Claude's `disallowedTools:` denylist and OpenCode's
`permission:` map (see [subagents](subagents.md)). Parallelization works in
both tools: the build phase fans out independent tasks' investigation and
review concurrently. Dialogs belong to the orchestrator alone — subagents
have the question tool denied and return a `Questions:` section instead —
and gate decisions are asked through an interactive dialog (`onto gate
--json` supplies the structured decision; the skill renders it). The
orchestrator — your main session — still owns every edit and commit.

## Working in a dirty tree

Uncommitted work is normal: an interrupted task, a parallel change, your own
edits. onto classifies it rather than treating "dirty" as one condition.
`onto dirt [change] [--json]` reports every uncommitted path in three
classes:

| Class | What it is | Blocks this change's close? |
|---|---|---|
| `own` | the change's own `docs/changes/<name>/` artifacts | **yes** — its evidence must be committed |
| `change` | another change's docs, or the archive | no — that change's own close gate owns it |
| `source` | any other path in the repo | **yes** — until it is attributed and committed |

That split lets two changes be in flight at once: one change's half-written
proposal no longer blocks another change's close. When close *is* blocked,
the refusal names the offending paths instead of a bare "dirty worktree".

The division of labor is deliberate. The **binary** owns what-is-dirty and
what-blocks-close (structure, not judgment); the **agent** owns attribution,
deciding whether a `source` diff belongs to the current change, belongs
elsewhere, or is unclear enough to stop and ask. The skills follow a shared
dirty-workspace protocol for that, and never revert or commit around
uncommitted work they haven't attributed.

## Surviving context loss

Long agent sessions get compacted. `onto handoff <change>` emits a compact
recovery context pack — identity, phase, pending gate, artifact excerpts
plus a content hash — and `--write` persists it under the workspace, so a
fresh session resumes without re-deriving state. `onto set build-pause
plan-ready` records a first-class pause at the plan-ready gate for the same
reason.

## Recommended tooling

The onto skills recommend two tools; when either is missing they warn and
proceed. A degraded session still works:

- **rtk** — a token-optimized CLI proxy; workflow shell operations go
  through it when installed. Missing rtk means higher token cost, never a
  stop.
- **graphify** (https://graphify.net) — codebase understanding; the open and
  design phases ground claims in graphify/codegraph queries when available,
  falling back to direct file reading otherwise.

The principles the skills enforce throughout — build only what the change
needs, as simply as it can be built — are spelled out in [YAGNI](yagni.md)
and [KISS](kiss.md). The lightweight sibling workflow is
[to](to-workflow.md); the two frameworks are an exclusive choice per
repository.

# /handoff

Compact this conversation into a handoff document for a fresh agent with no prior
context. If the `handoff` skill is installed, follow it; otherwise apply the same
contract below.

Write to the OS temp directory (not the workspace) as
`handoff-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>.md`, for a reader who has the repo but none of this
chat. Capture decisions and their reasons, not a transcript. Reference durable
artifacts (specs, plans, ADRs, issues, commits, diffs) by path or URL rather than
restating them.

Cover: **Goal**, **Current state**, **Done** (with commit shas / paths),
**Next** (ordered, specific), **Key files & pointers**, **Open questions &
decisions** (with rationale), **Gotchas**, and **Suggested skills**.

Keep it self-contained, redact any secrets, and print the saved path when done.

`$ARGUMENTS`, if present, describes the next session's focus — weight the Next and
Key-files sections toward it.

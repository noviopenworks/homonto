# Receiving review — verify before you implement

When the `code-reviewer` subagent (or a human, or a PR reviewer) returns
findings, they are **input to evaluate, not instructions to execute**. A review
loop that implements every finding blindly ships the reviewer's mistakes too —
and since v0.1.3 wired the reviewer into build, this discipline is load-bearing.

Core principle: **verify before implementing; ask before assuming; technical
correctness over agreement.**

## The response pattern (per finding)

1. **Read** the whole finding without reacting.
2. **Understand** — restate the claim in your own words; if you can't, it's
   unclear (see below).
3. **Verify** — check the claim against the actual code. Does the failure
   scenario it describes really occur? Read the surrounding code the reviewer may
   not have seen.
4. **Evaluate** — is it correct *for this codebase*? Does it break existing
   behavior? Is there a reason the current code is the way it is?
5. **Respond** — a technical acknowledgment, or **reasoned pushback with
   evidence** if the finding is wrong.
6. **Implement** — one finding at a time, verify each (the task's test/build),
   before the next.

## Forbidden

- Performative agreement — "you're absolutely right", "great catch" — then
  implementing. Say nothing; act, or push back with reasoning.
- Implementing before verifying. A plausible-sounding finding can still be wrong
  for this code.
- Implementing a **subset** when some findings are unclear: items may be related,
  and partial understanding produces a wrong change. **Stop and ask** about the
  unclear ones first.

## When a finding is wrong

Push back with the specific technical reason and the code that refutes it — do
not silently drop it (the reviewer or user may know something you don't) and do
not implement it. If you cannot verify it either way, say so: "I can't confirm
this without <X> — investigate, ask, or proceed?"

## Severity, in the onto build loop

The reviewer already ranks findings. **CRITICAL** (correctness, security, a
failed core scenario) is fixed via a re-dispatched `onto-implementer` before the
next task — *after* you've verified it is real. Non-critical findings you accept
are recorded in the plan or the commit body; ones you reject are noted with the
reason. When severity is unclear, do not inflate it.

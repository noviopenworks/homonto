# onto reference — commands, flow, and gates

The precise reference for the `onto` binary: how a change **enters** the
workflow, how it **moves** between phases, the exact **gates** each
transition enforces, and every command. For the conceptual overview and the
skills side, read [the onto workflow](onto-workflow.md) first.

The **`onto` binary owns the state and the gates**; the `onto-*` skills own
the work inside each phase. Every state change goes through the binary
(`onto new`, `onto set …`, `onto advance`, `onto close`). The skills never
hand-edit `onto-state.yaml`, and the phase is always cross-checked against
real file state.

Most commands take `--dir <root>` (default `.`) to select the workspace
root. Mutating commands require the onto framework to be installed by
homonto; read-only ones never read `homonto.toml` and never write.

## General flow

```
                 ┌─────────────────── onto advance (one phase per call) ───────────────────┐
                 ▼                                                                          │
   onto new → [ open ] → [ design ] → [ build ] → [ verify ] → [ close ] ──── onto close ──→ archived/
                                                                                   (terminal, success)

   presets:   --workflow fix / tweak run a reduced path (open-lite → build → verify → close),
              and upgrade to the full path when scope grows.

   failure:   onto abandon <change>  →  abandoned  (the unsuccessful terminal state)
```

A change tracks its phase and evidence in
`docs/changes/<name>/onto-state.yaml`. The phase set is exactly
`open → design → build → verify → close`; `close` is the terminal phase
(reached by advancing), after which `onto close` **archives** the change.
There is no `archive` phase.

## Entering — `onto init` and `onto new`

**`onto init [--dir <root>]`** scaffolds the `docs/{changes,specs,adr,guides}/`
layout, idempotently. It reports created vs. skipped paths and never
overwrites existing content.

**`onto new <name> [--workflow full|fix|tweak]`** creates
`docs/changes/<name>/` with:

- `onto-state.yaml` at **phase `open`**, `workflow: full` (the default);
- a `proposal.md` skeleton — plus `tasks.md` **only for the fix/tweak
  presets**; a full change's `tasks.md` is derived later, in design.

It requires the framework installed, refuses to clobber an existing change,
and validates that the name is kebab-case with no path traversal.

## Advancing — `onto advance <change>`

Each call attempts **one** transition and writes nothing unless every gate
below passes, in this order:

1. **Framework installed** (the install gate) and a **valid change name**.
2. State **loads** and the change is **not abandoned**.
3. The current phase has a **next phase** (advancing from `close` is an
   error).
4. **Required artifacts** for the *current* phase all exist — **workflow-aware**
   (they accumulate). A full change derives its task list *from* the
   confirmed design, so `tasks.md` gates the **design** exit, not the open
   exit. The fix/tweak presets skip design and decompose at open-lite, so
   their `tasks.md` gates the **open** exit and no `design.md`/`plan.md` is
   ever demanded (this is what lets a preset advance straight through
   design and build):

   | Leaving phase | full | fix / tweak |
   |---|---|---|
   | `open`   | `proposal.md` | `proposal.md`, `tasks.md` |
   | `design` | + `design.md`, `tasks.md` | *(pass-through — no `design.md`)* |
   | `build`  | + `plan.md` (and all tasks checked) | all tasks checked (no `plan.md`) |
   | `verify` | + `verification.md` | + `verification.md` |

   An empty or unknown workflow is treated as full (strictest).

5. **Leaving `build`:** `tasks.md` has **no unchecked items** (`- [ ]`).
6. **Evidence / entry tokens** (recorded via `onto set`, not inferred from
   files):
   - **Entering `build`** (design→build): `isolation` is set (`branch` or
     `worktree`), so planning and build work is never committed unisolated —
     **and** the change is **not in a dependency cycle** (no valid build
     order exists).
   - **Leaving `verify`** (verify→close): `verify.result == pass`.
7. **Worktree cleanliness:** entering `close` is **blocked** by uncommitted
   paths — except paths under *another* change's `docs/changes/<other>/`,
   which are that change's own close gate's obligation (parallel changes
   must not deadlock each other) — *and* blocked if cleanliness cannot even
   be determined (no git). The refusal lists the offending paths;
   `onto dirt <change>` shows the full classified list. Every other
   transition only **warns** on a dirty worktree and proceeds.

A failed gate exits non-zero and leaves the recorded phase unchanged.

## Merging specs — `onto merge-deltas <change>`

Before archiving, the close phase merges the change's spec deltas into the
living specs with `onto merge-deltas`: a deterministic
RENAMED → MODIFIED → REMOVED → ADDED application, lint-checked,
**transactional** (writes nothing unless every delta merges clean), and
**idempotent** (it sets and honors `close.merged`). This replaces the
by-hand merge that was the workflow's most destructive step.

## Exiting — `onto close <change>`

Archives a change that has reached the `close` phase. Gates, in order:

1. Framework installed; valid name; state loads.
2. Phase **is `close`** (advance until it reaches close first).
3. **Close-evidence gate** — the tokens the workflow produces:
   - `verify.result == pass`, **and**
   - `close.merged == true`, **and**
   - for the **full** workflow only, **guides resolved**: `guides` is
     `updated` or `waived:<reason>`. The fix/tweak presets produce no
     guides, so they skip this; an empty or unknown workflow is treated as
     full.
4. **Dependencies resolved** — every change in `deps` is already archived
   (a `docs/changes/archive/*-<dep>/` exists).
5. **Clean, determinable worktree** (same rule as entering close).
6. **No-clobber** — the dated archive target must not already exist.

On success it sets `archived: true` and moves the workspace to
`docs/changes/archive/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<name>/`. The move is transactional: if
it fails after the flag is written, the flag is rolled back, so a failed
close never leaves a change marked archived at its original path.

**`onto abandon <change>`** is the other terminal state — the unsuccessful
one — for work that stops rather than completes.

## Recording evidence — `onto set <field> <change> [value]`

Gate tokens live in `onto-state.yaml` and are set through `onto set`, never
by hand:

| `onto set` field | Gate it satisfies / records |
|---|---|
| `isolation <branch\|worktree>` | required to **enter build** |
| `integration <merge\|pr>` | how the branch is integrated at close — merge into base, or open a PR (the onto-close skill performs the git work) |
| `build-pause <plan-ready\|clear>` | record/clear a first-class pause at the plan-ready gate so a fresh session resumes without re-planning |
| `verify-result <pass\|fail\|…>` | `pass` required to **leave verify** and to **close**; `fail` also increments `observed.verify_rounds` (≥3 is an `onto doctor` finding) |
| `verify-scale` | records the verification level for the verify phase (see `onto scale --set`) |
| `close-merged` | sets `close.merged=true`, required to **close** |
| `guides <updated\|waived:<reason>>` | required to **close** a full workflow |
| `deps --dep <name> …` | dependency list; each must be archived before **close** |
| `build-mode`, `tdd-mode` | records how build executes |
| `base-ref` | the git ref the change branched from (input to `onto scale`) |
| `supersedes`, `deviates-from` | cross-change relationships (surfaced by `onto graph`) |
| `directive` | a verbatim pre-authorization directive on the change |

## Read-only inspection (no gates, config-independent)

| Command | What it reports |
|---|---|
| `onto status` | each active change's derived phase and skeleton validity |
| `onto state <change> [--json]` | a change's full state |
| `onto gate <change> [--json]` | the pending evidence gate(s), as a structured schema (question, header, options, the `onto set` that records the answer) a skill renders as a dialog |
| `onto scale <change> [--json] [--set]` | the verification level derived from the measured `base_ref..HEAD` diff (non-test files, changed lines); `--set` records it via `verify-scale` |
| `onto graph [--json] [--check]` | the change dependency graph (`{nodes, edges, cycles}`); `--check` exits non-zero on a cycle — the same cycles the build gate rejects |
| `onto dirt [change] [--json]` | every uncommitted path in the worktree, classified against the change: `own` (the change's own `docs/changes/<name>/` artifacts), `change` (another change's docs — tolerated by the close gate), `source` (everything else — blocks close). The deterministic half of the dirty-workspace protocol: the binary owns what-is-dirty and what-blocks-close; attribution of `source` dirt stays with the agent |
| `onto handoff <change> [--write]` | a compact recovery context pack (identity, phase, pending gate, artifact excerpts + a content hash) for continuing after a context compaction; `--write` persists it under `docs/changes/<name>/.onto/handoff/` |
| `onto doctor [--quiet]` | workspace health across layout, state, phase/artifact match, dependency resolution, and archive layout; non-zero on any finding. Also reports **version skew** between the `onto` binary and the homonto that installed the framework (fix with `homonto update`), and ≥3 failed verify rounds. `--quiet` prints nothing and signals via exit code only — the hook primitive (see [enforcement](enforcement.md)) |
| `onto version` | the release-stamped version |

## Driving it from the tool — slash commands

`homonto apply` installs a slash command per phase and preset, so you can
drive the flow from the command palette: `/onto` (the dispatcher — it
derives the active change's phase and routes automatically), plus
`/onto-open`, `/onto-design`, `/onto-build`, `/onto-verify`, `/onto-close`,
`/onto-fix`, `/onto-tweak`, and `/onto-no-slop`. Each command loads its
matching skill; the binary still owns every state change.

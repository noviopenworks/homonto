description: to workflow dispatcher. Use when starting, resuming, or asking about development work in a repo with the docs/tasks/ layout — checks the to binary, finds the active change via `to status --json`, and routes to the matching to sub-skill.

# to — Dispatcher

to is a minimal coding framework for LLMs: three phases — **plan → do →
done** — and the smallest structure that still makes agent-written code good.
The `to` binary is the bookkeeper and the single authority for
`to-state.yaml`; the skills carry the discipline. **Every state mutation goes through the binary**
(`to new`, `to phase`, `to done`, `to abandon`) — never hand-edit the state
file. The binary enforces no evidence gates: `to done --verified` records a
self-asserted checkbox, so the verification rigor in `to-done` is the only
verification there is. Do not treat the checkbox as a guarantee.

The dispatcher does three things, in order, and never performs phase work
itself.

## 1. Preflight

Run `to version`. On failure, STOP: the skills drive all workflow state
through the `to` binary; without it no phase can mutate state safely. Tell the
user to install/build it (`go build ./cmd/to`) before proceeding.

## 2. Discover

Run `to status --json` and find the active change.

- **One active change** → that is the change; note its phase.
- **No active change** and `$ARGUMENTS` (or the conversation) describes new
  work → create one: `to new <kebab-name>`, then treat it as phase plan.
- **No active change and no described work** → ask what to work on.
- **Several active changes** → ask which one, unless the conversation names it.
- An entry with an `error` field is a corrupted state file — surface it to the
  user instead of guessing; the binary owns that file.

Resuming after a context compaction? `to handoff <name>` prints the recovery
pack (phase, plan excerpt, next skill) — read it before doing anything.

## 3. Route

Load and follow the sub-skill for the change's phase:

| Phase | Sub-skill |
|---|---|
| plan | `to-plan` |
| do | `to-do` |
| finishing do (work complete, verifying) | `to-done` |

Terminal phases (`done`, `abandoned`) route nowhere — the change is archived;
start a new one.

## Delegation rules (all phases)

The sub-skills delegate to the `to-explorer`, `to-implementer`, `to-reviewer`,
and `to-skeptic` subagents. **One subagent at a time, strictly sequential —
never dispatch subagents in parallel.** The sequential transcript a human can
follow is the point; parallel fan-out is onto's territory. onto and to are
mutually exclusive per repository — never mix their artifacts or advice.

All prose the change keeps (`plan.md`, its notes and verification record, and
commit messages) goes through the `to-no-slop` rules before it lands.

# The to workflow

**to** is the minimal coding framework for LLMs that homonto ships as a
bundled framework. It has two halves that work together:

- the **`to` binary** (built from `cmd/to/`, installed beside `homonto`) — the
  bookkeeper: it creates change workspaces, records the one phase transition,
  archives finished changes, and answers `status`/`handoff`/`doctor` from
  state only it writes; and
- the **`to-*` skills** (materialized from the builtin catalog by
  `homonto apply`) — the agent-facing process prose that drives the work
  inside each phase.

The binary owns the *state*; the skills own the *discipline*. A change moves
through three phases in a fixed order:

```
plan → do → done
```

`done` and `abandoned` are terminal (the change is then archived). Each change
tracks its phase in a `to-state.yaml` inside its workspace directory — always
written through the binary, never by hand.

Unlike onto, **to enforces no evidence gates**: `to done --verified` records a
self-asserted checkbox, not observed proof. The verification rigor lives
entirely in the `to-done` skill (a real verify run plus one adversarial
skeptic pass). That trade is the product: much less ceremony per change, no
guarantee from the binary. Design rationale:
[to-framework-design.md](../to-framework-design.md).

## onto or to — an exclusive choice

One repository uses one workflow framework. Declaring both
`[frameworks.onto]` and `[frameworks.to]` in one `homonto.toml` fails at
load. Pick **onto** for evidence-gated changes that need spec deltas,
dependency graphs, and non-skippable transitions; pick **to** for simple
development where that machinery costs more than it protects. There is no
escalation path between their state formats — choose per repository, not per
change.

## Install and enable

```bash
go install github.com/noviopenworks/homonto/cmd/to@latest
to version
```

The mutating commands require the framework to be **declared and applied
through homonto first** — this is how the skills land in your tools:

```toml
[frameworks.to]
source = "builtin:to"
scope = "project"
# plus the [models.<tool>.*] routes — see the configuration reference
```

Then `homonto apply`. It also installs the slash commands: `/to` (the
dispatcher — it finds the active change via `to status --json` and routes),
plus `/to-plan`, `/to-do`, `/to-done`, and `/to-no-slop`.

## The layout

Each change is a directory `docs/tasks/<name>/` holding `to-state.yaml`
(written **only** by the binary) and `plan.md` (written by the agent during
plan). Finished changes move to `docs/tasks/archive/<date>-<name>/`; the date
prefix frees the name for reuse. `to` is **git-blind**: it never inspects
branches, worktrees, or dirt — branch-per-change is skill advice, not a gate.

## The plan contract

`plan.md` is the change's single durable human-authored record. It starts
with the goal, approach, and scope boundary, followed by ordered tasks:

```markdown
- [ ] <Concrete outcome>
  - Files: `<paths and, when useful, symbols>`
  - Change: <behavior or contract to add, remove, or preserve>
  - Verify: `<exact command>` — <specific passing signal>
```

Implementation and its focused tests stay in the same task. **The task list
is live during `do`**: discovered work is appended with the same contract
(outcome suffixed `(discovered <date>)`, placed before `Final Verify:`)
before its code is written; tasks are checked off in the commit that
completes them; a task made unnecessary is checked as
`- [x] SUPERSEDED: <reason>` rather than deleted. Decisions and declined
review findings go under `## Notes`. A distinct `Final Verify:` line names
the whole-change command; its literal result, coverage gaps, and the skeptic
verdict go under `## Verification`. One archived artifact carries planning,
recovery, review, and final evidence.

## Phase walkthrough

- **plan** (`/to-plan`) — ground the approach in reading (dispatch
  `to-explorer` for multi-file questions), write `plan.md` per the contract,
  de-slop it, then `to phase <name>`.
- **do** (`/to-do`) — execute one task at a time: `to-implementer` writes it,
  the orchestrator verifies against the repository, `to-reviewer` judges the
  diff, findings are fixed or declined in writing, the task is checked off in
  its own commit. Strictly sequential — **to never runs subagents in
  parallel**.
- **done** (`/to-done`) — run `Final Verify:`, obtain one completed
  `to-skeptic` pass on the final candidate, record the outcome under
  `## Verification`, then `to done <name> --verified --evidence "…"` archives
  the change.

`to abandon <name>` is the terminal exit without done, from any phase.

## Specialist subagents

onto's cast, adapted — one at a time, never in parallel:

| Subagent | Role |
|---|---|
| `to-explorer` | Read-only codebase questions; returns conclusions, not dumps. |
| `to-implementer` | Executes one task from its written contract; reports (never does) discovered work. |
| `to-reviewer` | Judges each diff for correctness, security, contract (including silent scope creep), clarity. |
| `to-skeptic` | One fresh-context pass in `to-done`, prompted to refute the "it works" claim — claims first, then gaps. |

The sequential transcript a human can follow is the point; parallel fan-out
is onto's territory.

## Surviving context loss

`to handoff <name>` prints a compact recovery pack — identity, phase, the
safe next skill, and a plan excerpt built for resuming: the head, every
unchecked task contract, `Final Verify:`, and bounded notes/verification
sections. A fresh session reads it, then continues from the first unchecked
task. `to doctor` is the health check (and, with `--quiet`, the enforcement
hook primitive — see [enforcement](enforcement.md)).

## Where the details live

Every command, flag, and crash-safety behavior:
[to reference](to-reference.md). The principles the skills enforce:
[YAGNI](yagni.md) and [KISS](kiss.md).

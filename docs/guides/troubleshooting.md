# Troubleshooting & caveats

Known limitations of the beta line, common gotchas, and their workarounds.

## Building & installing

**`go build .` fails with `build output "homonto" already exists and is a
directory`.** The output name collides with the `homonto/` content directory
next to `main.go`, and `go build -o homonto .` silently deposits the binary
*inside* that directory. Use `go install .`, `go run .`, or build to an
explicit path outside the content dir:

```bash
go build -o ./bin/homonto .
```

**Version prints empty or wrong after `go install`.** Release builds stamp
the version at link time:

```bash
go install -ldflags "-X github.com/noviopenworks/homonto/internal/cli.Version=1.2.3" .
```

**Installed a newer binary but tools still have old content.** Installing a
binary does not touch projected content. Run `homonto update`; it
re-materializes the embedded catalog at the running version and re-projects
it. `onto doctor` and `to doctor` report a **version skew** finding when a
workflow binary and the homonto that installed its framework have drifted
apart.

**I changed a model but my agents still show the old one.** Fixed in
v0.2.0. A subagent's `model:` is stamped from its configured model block
(today `[subagents.<name>.<tool>]`; tier routes before v0.8.0) at
materialization, and materialization used to be gated on the catalog version
alone — so a route change left the rendered agents frozen while the tool's
own `setting.model` moved, giving two different answers from one config.
Upgrade and run `homonto apply`. On an older binary, force a
re-materialization:

```bash
rm -rf .homonto/catalog && homonto apply --yes
```

## Scripting

**"My script captures nothing."** homonto, onto, and to print through
cobra, which writes to **stderr**. Redirect with `2>&1`.

**Exit codes.** By default commands exit `0`/non-zero. The richer taxonomy
is opt-in: `plan --exit-code` exits `2` on pending changes; `status
--exit-code` exits `2` on pending and `3` on drift. `--output json` on
`plan`, `status`, and `doctor` gives machine-readable output; on the onto
side, `state --json`, `gate --json`, `scale --json`, and `graph --json` do,
and to's workflow commands take `--json`.

## Projection

**OpenCode comments disappeared.** Claude's files are plain JSON, but
OpenCode's `opencode.jsonc` supports comments — and any apply that *writes*
that file rewrites it as normalized JSON, removing all comments. A
skills-only or otherwise no-op apply does not write the file, so comments
survive those. Accepted for beta.

**"Conflict" reported on a skill or subagent link.** homonto never clobbers
a file that is not its own symlink. A real file, or a link pointing
elsewhere at the target path, is reported instead of overwritten. Move the
conflicting file out of the way and re-apply.

**I moved/renamed my homonto repo and now everything conflicts.** Skill
symlinks store an **absolute** target, so after a move the existing links
point at the old path, and `apply`/`status` report conflicts rather than
silently repointing — homonto never changes a symlink it cannot prove it
owns. Delete the stale links and re-run `apply` to relink at the new
location.

**A tool file was reported unparseable.** That adapter aborts and reports;
homonto never overwrites a file it cannot parse. Fix the JSON by hand (or
restore it) and re-apply. The other tool's apply is unaffected.

**Something I configured by hand got pruned.** Only resources homonto
recorded in state are ever pruned — but note that a declared resource
matching disk is *adopted* into state (see
[projection & state](projection-and-state.md)), after which removing it
from `homonto.toml` removes it from the tool too. That is the contract: the
TOML is the source of truth for everything it declares.

## Secrets

**`apply` aborts with a resolution error.** `${pass:…}` needs
[`pass`](https://www.passwordstore.org/) on `PATH` (and the entry present);
`${ENV_VAR}` needs the variable set at apply time. Nothing was written —
apply resolves all secrets before touching any file. `homonto doctor` flags
a missing `pass`.

## Scope of the adapters

- **Claude Code and OpenCode** are the full adapters.
- **Codex** (OpenAI Codex CLI) is a pilot: it projects **MCP servers only**,
  into `~/.codex/config.toml` `[mcp_servers.<name>]`, and is **opt-in** — a
  resource must list `codex` in its `targets`. Listing `codex` on a
  subagent has no effect.
- **Frameworks** resolve from the builtin catalog (`onto` or `to`, mutually
  exclusive), a `local:` root, or a digest-pinned `remote:` source.
- **Remote sources** (subagents and frameworks) require a
  `digest = "sha256:…"` pin (see
  [remote source trust](remote-source-trust.md)). homonto never re-resolves
  a pin to newer content; updating is a config edit you make.

## `import` is narrow

`homonto import` reads **Claude's global MCP servers only** (`~/.claude.json`
`mcpServers`). It skips non-stdio (url/http) servers with a warning, redacts
env values that *look* like secrets into `${pass:…}` references
(best-effort), copies `command`/`args` verbatim, and imports no skills,
plugins, settings, or OpenCode config. Review its output before applying or
committing. It refuses to overwrite an existing config without `--force`.

## onto

**`onto new`/`advance`/`close` refuse to run.** The mutating commands
require the onto framework to be installed *by homonto*
(`[frameworks.onto]` + `homonto apply`). The read-only commands (`status`,
`state`, `gate`, `scale`, `graph`, `handoff`, `dirt`, `doctor`, `version`)
always work.

**`advance` fails.** The error names the gate: a missing artifact for the
current phase, an unset evidence token (`isolation` before build), an
unchecked `tasks.md` item leaving build, or a dirty worktree entering
close. Run `onto gate <change>` to see the pending decision(s) and the
exact `onto set` that records each one.

**`close` fails.** Check, in order: the change is at phase `close`;
`verify.result == pass`; `close.merged == true` (run `onto merge-deltas`);
guides resolved (full workflow); every `deps` entry archived; worktree
clean; archive target not already present.

**"dirty worktree blocks close."** The error lists the first few offending
paths; `onto dirt <change>` shows all of them, classified. Paths under
*another* change's `docs/changes/<other>/` never block (they are that
change's obligation). What blocks is this change's own uncommitted
artifacts and any uncommitted source path. Commit what belongs to the
change, stash or attribute what doesn't, and retry.

**Repeated verify failures.** `onto set verify-result fail` increments a
counter; at ≥3 rounds `onto doctor` reports it. The workflow expects a
human decision at that point (accept the deviation or keep fixing), not an
endless loop.

**Recovering after context compaction.** `onto handoff <change>` emits a
compact recovery pack (`--write` persists it) so a fresh agent session can
resume without re-deriving state.

## to

**`to init`/`new`/`phase`/`done`/`abandon` refuse to run.** Same rule as
onto: the mutating commands require the to framework installed *by homonto*
(`[frameworks.to]` + `homonto apply`). The read-only commands (`status`,
`handoff`, `doctor`, `version`) always work.

**"[frameworks.onto] and [frameworks.to] are mutually exclusive."** By
design: one workflow framework per repository. Remove one declaration and
re-apply; the removed framework's projected content is pruned.

**A change shows a terminal phase but still sits in `docs/tasks/`.** An
interrupted finish (a crash between the state write and the archive move).
`to doctor` reports it; re-run the same finishing command
(`to done <name> --verified` or `to abandon <name>`) to complete the
archive.

**"another to command is in progress (lock held at …)".** A concurrent
session holds `docs/tasks/.to.lock`, or a killed process left it behind.
The file records the holder's pid; if nothing is running, remove it by
hand.

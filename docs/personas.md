# Which workflow? — homonto, onto, and the alternatives

This project ships more than one way to drive spec-driven work, which is
confusing until you see the hierarchy. This page is the selection matrix (it
exists because the 2026-07-13 review found no persona/selection guidance — F21).

## The hierarchy

**homonto is the product.** It is a declarative configuration projector for AI
coding tools: one TOML config is planned, confirmed, and atomically projected
into each tool's native files, with state tracking ownership and drift, and
fail-closed remote sources. If you use nothing else here, you use homonto.

**onto is homonto's native, binary-enforced spec-driven workflow.** The `onto`
binary owns one versioned state schema and gates the change lifecycle
(`open → design → build → verify → close`) — you cannot advance or close on
missing artifacts or a malformed state, because the binary refuses. onto has a
**hard dependency on the compiled binary** (it is *not* markdown-only), and the
markdown skills invoke the binary rather than editing state by hand.

**Comet, OpenSpec, and Superpowers are unenforced alternative workflows** —
they drive the same spec-driven shape (propose → design → build → verify →
archive) through skills and prose, without a binary gate: more flexible and
portable, but nothing mechanically prevents skipping a step. **homonto no
longer ships them**: the catalog carries onto (and, later, `to`) plus the
loose framework-agnostic skills, nothing else. This repository still uses
Comet for its own development — from the maintainers' own setup, not from the
catalog.

## What onto enforces (and what it doesn't)

onto's binary guarantee is **B1: an honest agent cannot skip a step.** It
enforces the *presence and shape* of the state and evidence the workflow
produces — a phase advances only when the required artifacts exist and the state
is well-formed. It does **not** re-derive judgment (it does not read your design
and decide it is good, or run your tests for you). Its threat model is
**T-honest**: it defends against a forgetful or sloppy agent, not a malicious one
forging an audit trail on your own repo. (The *projection engine* is different —
it consumes remote content and deletes files, so it is hardened against a real
adversary.)

## Choosing

| You want… | Use |
|---|---|
| To project one config into Claude Code / OpenCode / Codex | **homonto** (the projector — always) |
| A spec-driven change lifecycle with mechanical gates you can't skip | **onto** (needs the binary) |
| A flexible, portable, prose-driven workflow with no binary gate | **Comet** / OpenSpec / Superpowers (external — not shipped by homonto) |

## Why we build with Comet but ship onto

Honesty matters here: **this repository is developed with Comet, not onto.** onto
is a shipped-but-not-self-used product. That is a deliberate trade-off — Comet's
prose-driven flexibility fits how this repo's maintainers work day to day, while
onto's mechanical enforcement is the product we believe teams who *want* a
can't-skip-a-step guarantee should reach for.

The cost of not eating our own dog food is that onto misses the feedback loop
that hardened the projector. We offset it two ways, both intentional: onto's
correctness comes from a **full-lifecycle conformance test suite** (it asserts the
gates actually reject bad work, since no human catches it in daily use), and from
this page telling you plainly where onto fits — so "the maintainers don't use
this?" is an answered question, not a surprise.

# to-plan — Phase 1: Plan

Turn the request into a short, executable plan. The plan is a reviewable git
artifact — write it for the person who reads the PR, not for yourself.

## Entry check

- `to status --json` shows the change at `phase: plan`.
- If `plan.md` already has content, a previous session started planning —
  read it and continue rather than starting over.

## Steps

1. **Understand before writing.** Ground every claim about the codebase in
   reading. Read the repository's relevant ADRs and nearby design documents
   before planning a behavior or architecture change. For questions that span
   many files, dispatch `to-explorer` (one at a time, never in parallel) and
   work from its conclusions.
2. **Suggest isolation.** Recommend a branch for the change (the binary is
   git-blind and will not check; this is process advice, not a gate). The user
   may decline — proceed either way.
3. **Write `docs/tasks/<name>/plan.md`:**
   - A two-or-three-sentence statement of the goal, the chosen approach, and
     the important boundary (what this change deliberately does not do).
   - An ordered task list. Every task must be executable from cold context and
     use this compact contract:

     ```markdown
     - [ ] <Concrete outcome>
       - Files: `<paths and, when useful, symbols>`
       - Change: <behavior or contract to add, remove, or preserve>
       - Verify: `<exact command>` — <specific passing signal>
     ```

   - Keep one concern in each task and keep its implementation and focused
     tests together. Name dependencies only when order is not obvious. Resolve
     unknowns before advancing; "investigate", "handle edge cases", and "add
     tests" are not executable tasks without a named question, behavior, or
     case.
   - When the implementation changes durable architecture or contradicts an
     existing guide, design document, or ADR, include the smallest required
     documentation task. Do not create design ceremony for an implementation
     detail that existing documentation does not promise.
   - Reserve `## Notes` for decisions, scope clarifications, and declined
     review findings discovered during execution. Do not duplicate the task
     list there.
   - A `Final Verify:` line after the tasks: the narrowest command that proves
     the whole change works, plus the expected success signal. This distinct
     label prevents it from being confused with a task's nested `Verify:`.
   - When drafting or repairing a task contract, use
     [the good/bad examples](references/task-examples.md) to test whether an
     implementer could execute it without inventing scope.
4. **De-slop it.** Run the `to-no-slop` rules over the plan prose.
5. **Confirm scope with the user** if the plan grew beyond what they asked —
   otherwise proceed.
6. **Advance:** `to phase <name>`. The change is now at `do`; hand off to the
   `to-do` skill.

## Rules

- Keep the plan under a screen where possible. A plan nobody reads is
  ceremony, and ceremony is what to exists to avoid.
- A task is bite-sized when one implementer can finish and verify it without
  inventing requirements. Split by independently reviewable behavior, not by
  arbitrary file count or by separate "code" and "tests" tasks.
- Never hand-edit `to-state.yaml`; the binary owns it.
- If the work turns out to need evidence-gated phases, spec deltas, or a
  dependency graph, say so: that is onto-shaped work, and this repo chose to.
  Do not rebuild onto inside a plan.md.

// Package copyfile is a conflict-safe reconciler for homonto-managed CONTENT
// files — the copy-mode analogue of internal/link (which reconciles symlinks).
// A managed content file is a real file whose bytes homonto owns; ownership is
// proven by a recorded content hash from the last apply, so copyfile never
// clobbers a user's own file or a file another mechanism (e.g. a symlink)
// placed. It computes the plan; the caller performs the atomic writes. Three-way
// merge of local edits is layered on top by the caller (it is not this package's
// concern).

# /onto-verify

Run onto phase 4 (verify): pick a verification level from the change scale, check the implementation with fresh evidence, and write verification.md. Load and follow the `onto-verify` skill; if it is not installed, tell the user to
install the onto framework (declare `[frameworks.onto]`, then run `homonto
apply`) and stop. Every workflow state change goes through the `onto` binary —
never hand-edit `onto-state.yaml`.

`$ARGUMENTS`, if present, focuses this phase on the described work.

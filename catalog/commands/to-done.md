# /to-done

Run to phase 3 (done): run the plan's `Final Verify:` command, dispatch
`to-skeptic` sequentially until one pass completes on the unchanged final
candidate, triage its findings, record the outcome in `plan.md`, then finish with
`to done <name> --verified`. The
`--verified` flag is self-asserted by design — this skill is what makes the
assertion true before it is made; never pass it early. Commit the resulting
archived directory and terminal state. Load and follow the
`to-done` skill; if it is not installed, tell the user to install the to
framework (declare `[frameworks.to]`, then run `homonto apply`) and stop.

`$ARGUMENTS`, if present, focuses this phase on the described work.

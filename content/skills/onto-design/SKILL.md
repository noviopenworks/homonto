# onto-design — Phase 2: Deep Design

Produce a confirmed technical design before any implementation exists.
**Design cannot be skipped in the full workflow** — this phase is the reason
the full workflow exists.

## Entry check

- `state.yaml` has `phase: design` and `workflow: full`; `proposal.md`
  exists and was approved in open.
- Read `notes.md` first (create it from `onto-open/references/notes.md` if
  missing) — resume from Pending; never re-ask Confirmed. After
  compaction, notes.md is the *why*-recovery; the derivation table is the
  *where*-recovery.
- Presets never enter this phase — except a preset **upgraded** to full,
  which arrives here to backfill the design it skipped.
- **Revision entry**: if `design.md` exists marked `Status: Under
  revision`, this is a mid-build design revisit — the approach gate is
  re-asked **for the revised scope regardless of what notes.md Confirmed
  records** (the old approach answer does not cover the new scope; this
  overrides "never re-ask Confirmed" for exactly this gate).
  Re-confirmation writes a fresh `Status: Confirmed` + date and records
  the new answer in notes.md; the change then resumes build.
- Any other state → route back through `/onto`.

## Steps

### 1. Explore ground truth

Before proposing anything, read the real system: graphify/codegraph queries
for structure and call paths, then the actual files. Map the integration
points the proposal touches. Never design against an imagined codebase.

### 2. Question until clear

If goals, scope, constraints, or acceptance scenarios still have gaps, keep
asking — one question at a time. Do not write a design around an unresolved
unknown; resolve it or explicitly record it as a risk with a fallback.

### 3. Propose 2–3 approaches

Present genuinely different candidate approaches with trade-offs and a
recommendation. Lead with the recommended one and say why. Record the
candidates in `notes.md` before presenting.

**Parallel exploration (optional):** when the approaches are genuinely
open and substantial, you MAY dispatch 2–3 fresh-context agents, each
developing one approach sketch (architecture, key risks, effort) in
parallel; the main session synthesizes and still presents the comparison
itself. Never dispatch agents to make the choice — the gate below is the
user's.

Update `notes.md` after every clarification round and approach iteration —
before ending the turn, not after.

> **GATE (approach confirmation):** the user picks or adjusts an approach.
> The final `design.md` MUST NOT be written before this gate is answered.
> Always fresh input — a blanket directive does not pre-answer it.

**No implementation code in this phase.** Writing source code before a
confirmed design exists is prohibited, regardless of how simple the change
looks.

### 4. Write the design artifacts

After confirmation, write into the workspace, each from its canonical
template in this skill's `references/`:

- `design.md` — template: `references/design.md`. `Status: Confirmed` +
  `Confirmed: <date>` are the lines the phase derivation keys on.
- `adr/<slug>.md` — template: `references/adr-draft.md`; one draft per
  significant decision, `Status: Proposed`, **unnumbered** (numbers at
  close).
- `specs/<capability>.md` — template: `references/delta-spec.md`
  (ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED/RENAMED sections, SHALL first lines,
  GIVEN/WHEN/THEN scenarios — the close-phase lint enforces exactly that
  template's rules). Every behavior change needs a scenario; deltas stay
  living documents until close merges them.

Mark the confirmed approach in `notes.md`. Update `tasks.md` if the design
revealed different task boundaries.

## Exit checklist

- [ ] `design.md` exists, marked `Status: Confirmed` with date, and matches
      the user-confirmed approach
- [ ] An ADR draft exists for every significant decision named in design.md
- [ ] A delta spec scenario exists for every behavior change
- [ ] No implementation code was written
- [ ] `notes.md` records the confirmed approach and every decision made
- [ ] `state.yaml` phase advanced: `design → build`;
      `metrics.phases.design: <today>` stamped
- [ ] Announce the transition and load `onto-build`

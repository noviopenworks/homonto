# Projection & state — how apply actually works

This guide explains the mechanics behind `plan`/`apply`/`status`: the surgical
merge, symlinked content, state, drift vs. pending, adoption, and pruning.

## The pipeline

`homonto.toml` is parsed into one tool-agnostic desired-state model; each tool
(Claude Code, OpenCode, the Codex pilot) is an **adapter** that runs
`Read → Plan → Apply`:

1. **Read** the tool's current files.
2. **Plan** the diff against the desired state (`+` create, `~` update,
   `-` delete).
3. **Apply** — after confirmation and up-front secret resolution — writing each
   file **atomically** (temp + rename), so an interrupted run never leaves a
   half-written file.

State is persisted after each successful adapter, so a failure in the second
tool never loses the first tool's applied records.

## Surgical merge

homonto writes **only the keys it manages** and preserves every unmanaged key
already in the tool's file. Consequences:

- Your hand-added MCP servers, settings, and plugins survive every apply.
- An **unparseable** tool file makes that adapter abort and report — homonto
  never overwrites a file it cannot understand.
- Adapters write a file **only when a managed key inside it actually changes**
  — a skills-only apply leaves tool JSON files byte-for-byte untouched (which
  is also why OpenCode JSONC comments survive link-only applies, but not
  applies that rewrite `opencode.jsonc`).

## Owned content is symlinked

Skills you author live under `homonto/skills/` (the local provider root, next
to `homonto.toml`) and are **symlinked** into each tool, so editing the source
is instantly live everywhere. `apply` ensures the links exist and point
correctly; it **never clobbers** a real file or a symlink pointing elsewhere —
those are reported as conflicts instead.

Link-mode commands and subagents work the same way; copy-mode subagents are
projected as real managed files instead (see [subagents](subagents.md)).

> Symlinks store an **absolute** target. If you move or rename the repo,
> existing links point at the old path and are reported as conflicts — delete
> the stale links and re-run `apply` to relink (see
> [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)).

## State — `.homonto/state.json`

State lives next to your config and records the last-applied snapshot per
resource: the unresolved desired value plus a **sha256 hash** of the applied
value (never a plaintext secret — see [secrets](secrets.md)). It also records
the versions behind each apply (binary, catalog, per-framework), which is how
`homonto update` prints its version transition and `onto doctor` detects
binary/framework skew.

State also records the **catalog version** and a **subagent render
fingerprint** — a digest of the model routes the projected agents were stamped
from. Builtin content is only re-materialized when one of those inputs actually
moved (or a file it would write is missing), so a settled workspace stays a
true no-op while a changed `[models.<tool>.<role>]` route re-renders the agents
that read it.

Because a catalog file is reached through a name-based symlink, re-rendering it
changes no *projected* value and so produces an empty plan. `apply` runs anyway
in that case and reports `No projection changes; catalog re-materialized.` —
the same carve-out `remote:` sources get, and for the same reason.

State is generated; the scaffolded `.gitignore` excludes `.homonto/` by
default.

## `status`: drift vs. pending

`homonto status` compares the values homonto manages on disk against the state
snapshot and reports two **independent** things:

- **Drift** — a managed key changed on disk *outside homonto* since the last
  apply, or was deleted:

  ```
  claude setting.model drifted (will reset on apply)
  claude mcp.foo missing (deleted out of band)
  ```

- **Pending** — edits to `homonto.toml` that have not been applied yet. The
  disk still matches the last apply, so this is *not* drift; it is a count:

  ```
  1 config change(s) awaiting apply (run `homonto apply`)
  ```

When neither is present, `status` prints `No drift.` The distinction matters:
editing your config should not look like something changed your files behind
your back. Use `homonto plan` to see exactly what a pending apply would write.

For scripting, `status --exit-code` exits `2` on pending and `3` on drift, and
`--output json` emits the report structurally.

## Adoption: pre-existing resources are recorded quietly

When a declared resource already exists on disk with **exactly** the value
homonto would write — an MCP server you added by hand, or config bootstrapped
by `import` — `apply` **adopts** it: the resource is recorded into state with
no file write, no diff line, and no prompt.

- `plan` stays silent about adoption (it prints `No changes` when adoption is
  the only outstanding work — nothing will be *written*).
- `apply` performs the adoption even when it is the only work, without a
  confirmation prompt (only `state.json` is touched), and reports it:
  `Reconciled 1 pre-existing resource(s) into state.`

Why it matters: an adopted resource becomes fully managed — visible to drift
detection and, if you later remove it from `homonto.toml`, to pruning. Before
adoption, a hand-created resource could look managed while silently escaping
both.

Adoption never touches secret-bearing values (those are always re-applied so
the resolved value is verified), and an apply whose only effect is adoption
leaves `~/.claude.json`, `~/.claude/settings.json`, and `opencode.jsonc`
byte-for-byte unchanged — comments included.

## Pruning: removal is declarative too

Remove a resource from `homonto.toml` and the next `apply` deletes it from the
tool files (and removes owned-content links). Only resources homonto recorded
in state are ever pruned — your own hand-added keys are never touched.

## A typical loop

```console
$ homonto status
1 config change(s) awaiting apply (run `homonto apply`)   # you edited homonto.toml

$ homonto plan                                            # see the diff
claude:
  ~ setting.model: "opus" -> "sonnet"

$ homonto apply                                           # write it
...
Applied.

$ homonto status
No drift.                                                 # disk matches state
```

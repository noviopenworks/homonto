# onto-verify — Phase 4: Verify

Prove — with fresh evidence, not recollection — that the implementation does
what the design and specs say. **Evidence before assertions, always.**

## Entry check

- `state.yaml` has `phase: verify` and every `tasks.md` item is checked
  (items explicitly marked deferred-to-close are allowed).
- Read `notes.md` at entry when present — accepted decisions and recorded
  directives inform what to verify against.
- Unchecked tasks mean build isn't done — the dispatcher's derivation table
  will send this back to build; route through `/onto`.

## Steps

### 1. Scale check → verification mode

Set the verification scale via `onto set verify-scale <name> light|full`:

- **full** — `workflow: full`, any upgraded preset, a diff touching more
  than **5 non-test files** in `base_ref..HEAD` (the same count and
  test-file exclusion as the preset upgrade triggers — one rule, three
  citations), a new capability, **or a diff touching a security-sensitive
  surface** — secret resolution, remote fetch/verify, file deletion/pruning,
  or permission/ownership — regardless of file count. Scale keys on risk, not
  just size: a one-file security change is never under-scrutinized. Checks
  every delta-spec scenario, the full design, and the regression suite.
- **light** — a preset within its limits (≤5 non-test files, by
  construction under the upgrade gates) **and touching no security-sensitive
  surface** (else full applies). Checks the changed behavior's scenarios plus
  the regression suite; the report may be brief but never absent.

### 2. Check against design and specs

For **every scenario in every delta spec** (workspace `specs/*.md`): run the
command(s) that demonstrate the behavior and capture the actual output.
Walk `design.md`'s key decisions and confirm the implementation matches —
deviations are findings, not footnotes. Re-run stated verifications from
`plan.md` where they are cheap.

Rules of evidence:

- Every claim needs a fresh command + its literal output. No "should work",
  no "passed earlier", no stale logs.
- A scenario that cannot be demonstrated is a **fail**, not a skip.

### 2b. Adversarial pass

After the self-evidence table is drafted, follow
`references/adversarial.md`: **full mode requires two parallel
fresh-context skeptics** — conformance (refute each scenario claim) and
robustness (edge cases, drift/recovery paths) — prompted to refute, never
approve; light mode uses one optional skeptic with skips recorded. Triage
findings per the protocol: a refuted claim fails its scenario; new defects
are CRITICAL-fix or gate-decided deviations. **Non-waivable classes:** a
security defect, data loss, or a failed core-acceptance scenario is CRITICAL
and must be fixed — it is never waived, skipped, or gate-accepted as a
deviation, in light or full mode. Only lower-severity findings are eligible
for a recorded skip. No dispatch capability → record the skipped pass in the
report's Adversarial section (protocol-mandated skips live there, no acceptor
needed) — but a non-waivable-class finding already surfaced still blocks.

### 3. Regression

Run the project's full build and test suite. Capture the output. If the
project has no build/test suite (e.g. a content-only repo), record that
fact as the regression result — that is a valid result, not a skipped
check.

### 4. Write the report

Write `docs/changes/<name>/verification.md` from the canonical template
`references/verification.md` (header with machine-read `Result:` line,
scenario-evidence table, design conformance, adversarial pass, regression,
deviations). When deviations were accepted, the Result line carries their
count — `Result: pass (2 accepted deviations)` — so a pass with caveats is
visibly different from a clean one everywhere the line is read. Record the
result via `onto set verify-result <name> pass|fail`.

### 5. Failure gate

> **GATE (on any fail):** list the failing items and ask the user:
> **fix** (→ back to build: add tasks for the fixes in `tasks.md`; the
> unchecked tasks drive the dispatcher's derivation back to build (files win
> downward) — no phase field is written) or **accept deviation** (record each
> accepted deviation + its rationale in `verification.md`; the `Result:` line
> stays `pass`, run `onto set verify-result <name> pass` (accepted deviations
> recorded in `verification.md`), with the deviation count on the Result
> line). Always fresh input —
> never auto-accept a failure, and never *propose* acceptance as the easy
> path — the user raises it or it stays a failure. Record each failed
> round in `notes.md` (date + failing items) — notes, not `metrics`, is
> the durable counter, and `metrics` never gates anything. After three
> consecutive failed rounds recorded there, stop and make the user choose
> the path forward.

## Exit checklist

- [ ] `verification.md` exists with a `Result:` line and fresh evidence for
      every checked scenario, regression results included
- [ ] `verify.result: pass` recorded via `onto set verify-result <name> pass`
      and in the report (accepted deviations, if any, each recorded with
      rationale in the report)
- [ ] Adversarial pass run (or its skip recorded in the report's
      Adversarial section)
- [ ] onto-no-slop pass run over `verification.md`, score recorded in
      `notes.md` (`no-slop: verification <total>/50`; below 35 means
      revise before this gate) — never touch the machine-read `Result:`
      line or the evidence table structure
- [ ] Phase advanced verify → close via `onto advance <name>`
- [ ] **Commit the workspace**: `git add docs/changes/<name> && git commit`
      — every phase exits with its workspace committed
- [ ] Announce the transition and load `onto-close`

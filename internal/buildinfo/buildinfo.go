// Package buildinfo resolves the effective binary version. Release builds stamp

// gap by reading the module version the Go toolchain embeds in the binary.

// DevVersion is the unstamped default version every homonto-built binary is
// initialized with. Release builds override each CLI package's Version var via
// -ldflags "-X <pkg>.Version=..."; when unstamped (e.g. `go install ...@tag`,
// which applies no ldflags) Resolve recovers the module version. The literal
// lives here so the three CLIs (homonto, onto, to) cannot drift on the dev tag.
const DevVersion = "0.1.0-dev"

// Resolve returns current unless it still equals dev — meaning release ldflags
// did not stamp it — in which case it returns the main module version recorded in
// the build info when that is a real tagged version. `go install <path>@v1.2.3`
// records v1.2.3 as Main.Version; a plain `go build` or `go install .` records
// "" or "(devel)", for which the dev default is kept.

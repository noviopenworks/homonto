# Enforces workflow-skills-shell-out: the onto* and to* SKILL.md files must
# drive every state mutation through their binary (`onto` / `to`) — never a
# direct state-file write — and must not carry the retired "markdown-only /
# no external CLI" copy.
#
# Deliberately coarse (like spec-command-check.sh): a curated blocklist of
# mutation phrasings, metric-write references, and the no-CLI copy. It guards
# the "a skill hand-edits state.yaml" regression class, not full semantics.
# Scope is the workflow SKILL.md files only; references/ (which DOCUMENTS the
# schema, e.g. onto/references/state-yaml.md) and the no-slop skills are
# excluded.
